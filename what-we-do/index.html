    <h3 id="our-commitment-to-anti-racism">Our Commitment to Anti-Racism</h3>
    <p>
      At The Villages Community Development Corporation, we believe in the
      values of diversity, equity, and inclusion. More specifically, we believe
      in the variety of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, experiences, and people's
      inclusion regardless of their race, color, sex, language, national origin,
      religion, identity, or age. Our goal is to make all the Villages — East
      Village, Gold Coast, North Village, Islandview, Joseph Berry Subdivision,
      West Village, and Indian Village — a great place to live, work, and
      recreate. In addition to supporting the principles of diversity and
      inclusion, the Villages Community Development Corporation is on a journey
      to be an anti-racism organization.
    </p>
    <p>Our anti-racism statement is as follows:</p>
    <p>
      The Villages Community Development Corporation (VCDC) is an anti-racism
      organization. VCDC defines being an anti-racism organization, both
      externally and internally.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we acknowledge that this project will require all neighbors'
      cooperation, we must first purposefully identify, discuss, and confront
      issues of race and the impact they have on the organization, its systems,
      and our community. We will also challenge ourselves to understand and
      correct any inequities we may discover within VCDC and better understand
      ourselves during this purposeful process. Being an anti-racism
      organization is a journey we will take with our neighbors throughout the
      Villages, and it is the learning along the way that makes this work worth
      all of our efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, we are working to create an environment in the Villages where all
      residents and visitors, regardless of race or skin color, know they are
      valued. We acknowledge that racism can be unconscious or unintentional and
      some of our past actions could have been racist. Although VCDC may not
      have intended to carry racist beliefs or motivations, we are aware that
      without fully embracing and addressing underlying racial issues mistakes
      may have been made. Identifying discrimination as an issue does not
      automatically mean those involved are themselves racist or intended to
      impact others negatively. We also acknowledge that this project will
      require the cooperation of all neighbors, businesses, community
      organizations, and other stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this, our goal is to create and maintain an environment
      where our community feels safe to discuss race and its importance on our
      organization and our lives as neighbors. VCDC will continue to discuss and
      deepen our understanding of race and racism purposefully. As part of this
      journey, VCDC will also hold regular dialogue with and listen to community
      members to achieve an equitable standard of community transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are deeply committed to purposefully studying and confronting the
      impacts of race and racism throughout our organization and our community.
      This work can be uncomfortable and even painful to some, but we have found
      that the most significant challenges bear the greatest rewards.

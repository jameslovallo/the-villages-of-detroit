      Your generous financial support helps us to continue working on the behalf
      of all those who live in the Villages of Detroit. From breaking down
      barriers between and within neighborhoods to assisting with fighting
      housing insecurity in the Villages, we are committed to lifting up all of
      our residents and communities. Some of our services include advocating for
      neighborhood infrastructure upgrades, supporting community led programming
      efforts, lobbying the City for residential needs and connecting folks with
      resources or just generally serving as a sounding board. We look forward
      to expanding our reach and capacity in the coming months, and we will be
      able to do so with your support.
